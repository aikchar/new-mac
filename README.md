Make sure you've installed:

- [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html)

I usually setup things in this repo in this order after installing the above:

1. macports
2. git
3. bash
4. editorconfig
5. vscode
6. vim
7. dev
8. iterm2

If you trust me blindly (or you're me), run,

        $ make there-be-hackers
